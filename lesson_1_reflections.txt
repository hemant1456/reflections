How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it can exactly pinpoint the lines where changes were made,thus making 
    easier to see the changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    because if you have made any changes and made a mistake, accessing previous versions
    can always go back to previous versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do  you cin Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    because we can save when we make one logical change othervise in other cases changes
    can be saved when we are in between something making it useless to compare with different
    versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because of purpose of creation,git is designed for people who code

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show all the commits introduced and git diff will show all the changes made 
    between these two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can always go back to previous versions to restore.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
